# VR Project - Chinese Cooking

## Problem Statement
- In Chinese recipes, most of the time the amount of the spices for each dish is not weighted. The most common word that you can see is the “appropriate amount”. However, this makes it extremely hard for beginners to follow the instruction and make dishes because they don’t necessarily know how much is an “appropriate amount”. Therefore, to help first-time recipe learners understand the amounts to use for each dish, the team worked on VR experience for viewing the cooking procedure of traditional Chinese dishes.
