# VR Project - Chinese Cooking

## Final Prototyped
http://chinese-cooking.glitch.me



## Problem Statement
- In Chinese recipes, most of the time the amount of the spices for each dish is not weighted. The most common word that you can see is the “appropriate amount”. However, this makes it extremely hard for beginners to follow the instruction and make dishes because they don’t necessarily know how much is an “appropriate amount”. Therefore, to help first-time recipe learners understand the amounts to use for each dish, the team worked on VR experience for viewing the cooking procedure of traditional Chinese dishes.



## Interactions Prototyped

### Looking around
- This helps the user to build a first-person view of the whole kitchen environment and supports later actions.

### Interactive menu
- The gaze interaction allows users to more easily understand which recipe they are looking at and choose via size and color change.

### Selecting a recipe
- This supports one of the most important features of the application. By selecting a recipe from the menu, the user can acquire step by step guidance from ingredients to cutting methods to cook a specific Chinese dish.



## Feedback & List of Changes
Through our feedback section in class, we both positive and negative feedback about our project. We learned that although our prototype successfully accomplishes the tasks we set out to achieve, it’s still missing elements that brings the experience to life. To create an immersive and captivating experience, we decided to add the following elements:
1. Refine menu
2. glTF models for the ingredients
3. Ambient sound
4. Interaction-based sounds



## Lessons learned from digital prototyping
- Making a VR experience the first time with little experiences is definitely a difficult task. But after getting a few models to work, we understood that sometimes the only thing VR and AR prototyping needs is motivation. Due to the fact that A-Frame was a new concept to our team, we approached many different roadblocks while working on this project. Luckily, working in a group allowed us to overcome these roadblocks to build an engaging VR experience.  

- In our first iteration of design, we didn’t have any sound included, which made the VR prototype experience feel more like playing within a 3D model rather than within a VR environment. After the feedback section, we learned that we need to create our experience more immerse and try to engage the audience by using different types of elements within our prototype. After adding in different types of audio, we realized that sound plays a very important role in a VR environment. For our prototype, we included a background music that auto-plays after choosing a certain recipe, and also included an interaction-based click sound which is triggered when clicking on some models. After spending a copious amount of time working on this project, we feel like we have learned a lot about designing and developing an immersive VR experience, and would practice and carry on this experience in the future.
